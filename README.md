## Features
- View, add, edit, and delete urlwatch jobs from Telegram
- Manage filters and properties for each job
- Secure access via allowed user IDs
- Crontab integration: view, add, edit, and delete scheduled urlwatch jobs from Telegram
- Detailed help and usage instructions via `/start`

## Requirements
- urlwatch (installed and configured)
- crontab (cron service enabled)
- conda (recommended, for environment management, `miniforge` works)
- Telegram bot token and User ID (create bot and get token from @BotFather from Telegram and keep it secret)

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repo-url>
    cd CronWatchBot
    ```
2. **Create and activate a conda environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    conda create -n cronwatchbot python=3.12
    conda activate cronwatchbot
    ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. **Configure your bot:**
    - Copy `config/config.py.example` to `config/config.py` (or create manually).
    - Add your Telegram bot token and allowed user IDs:
      ```python
      TOKEN = "your-telegram-bot-token"
      ALLOWED_USER_IDS = [123456789, ...]
      ```
    - `config/config.py` is excluded from git for security (see `.gitignore`).

5. **Ensure urlwatch is set up:**
    - The bot expects your urlwatch jobs file at `~/.config/urlwatch/urls.yaml` by default.

## How to Use
- Activate your conda environment and run the bot:
    ```bash
    conda activate cronwatchbot
    python main.py
    ```
- Interact with your bot on Telegram.

### Quick Start for the Bot Interaction

Start the bot and use `/start` to see available commands.

1. Add a job to watch a website:
```
/add https://github.com/AnkS4/CronWatchBot CronWatchBot Repo
```

2. Edit the job to get specific information from the website:
```
/editfilter 1 xpath://span[@id="repo-stars-counter-star"] html2text strip
```

3. Add a job to run urlwatch job 1 every 30 minutes:
```
/crontab_add 1 30
```
